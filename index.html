                <p> Oh my God
                    Jump

                    Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games <br>
                    We got everything you want, honey, we know the names <br>
                    We are the people that can find whatever you may need <br>
                    If you got the money, honey, we got your disease. <br>

                    <br>

                    In the jungle, welcome to the jungle <br>
                    Watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees <br>
                    Mwah, ah, I wanna watch you bleed. <br>

                    <br>

                    Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day <br>
                    If you want it you're going to bleed, but it's the price you pay <br>
                    And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please <br>
                    You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get them for free. <br>

                    <br>

                    In the jungle, welcome to the jungle <br>
                    Feel my, my, my, my serpentine <br>
                    Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream. <br>

                    <br>

                    Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here everyday <br>
                    You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play <br>
                    If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually <br>
                    You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me <br>

                    <br>

                    In the jungle, welcome to the jungle <br>
                    Watch it bring you to your shun-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n, knees, knees <br>
                    Mwah, I wanna watch you bleed <br>

                    <br>

                    And when you're high, you never <br>
                    Ever want to come down <br>
                    So down, so down, so down, yeah <br>

                        <p> Released as the first single from Appetite for Destruction, “Welcome to the Jungle” stiffed at first — 
                            it took the massive crossover success of “Sweet Child o’ Mine” to ready radio for GN’R at their 
                            most unvarnished. The song’s inspiration, according to Axl Rose, was a hitchhiking trip that 
                            landed him in the Bronx, where a stranger approached him and said, “You know were you are? 
                            You’re gonna die, you’re in the jungle, baby!” Rose took this mockery  and turned it into an anthem.</p>
